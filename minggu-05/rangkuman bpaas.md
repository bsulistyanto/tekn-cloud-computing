Business Process as a Service (BPaaS)

Business process as a service (BPaaS) is a term for a specific kind of web-delivered or cloud hosting service that benefits an enterprise by assisting with business objectives. In the general sense, a business process is simply a task that must be completed to benefit business operations. Using the term BPaaS implies that the business process is being automated through a remote delivery model.
Business Process as a Service (BPaaS) is any type of horizontal or vertical business process that’s delivered based on the cloud services model. These cloud services — which include Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) — are therefore dependent on related services.
Advertising services such as Google Adsense, IBM Blueworks Live for business process management are some of the several publicly available services, whereas there are number of other services that today IT departments provide to their users within the firewall or to the trusted partners. Any business process (for example, payroll, printing, ecommerce) delivered as a service over the Internet and accessible by one or more web enabled interfaces (PC, smart devices and phones) can be considered as a Business Process as a Service (BPaaS). 
Vendors offer all sorts of services delivered through cloud technologies and the global IP network, including items like platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and IT as a service (ITaaS). Business process as a service often involves putting several of these options together to completely automate a business process. For a concrete example of BPaaS, think about certain kinds of tasks that businesses may need done on a regular basis. One example is transaction management. Credit card transactions may need to be recorded in a central database, or otherwise handled or evaluated. If a vendor can offer a company that same task performed and delivered through cloud hosted networks, that would be an example of BPaaS.
In delivering business automation remotely, vendors can help companies to plan even more efficiency and versatility into their operations. This is the kind of idea that BPaaS services address.

The following characteristics define BPaaS:
•	The BPaaS sits on top of the other three foundational cloud services: SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS.
•	A BPaaS service is configurable based on the process being designed.
•	A BPaaS service must have well-defined APIs so it can be easily connected to related services.
•	A BPaaS must be able to support multiple languages and multiple deployment environments because a business cannot predict how a business process will be leveraged in the future.
•	A BPaaS environment must be able to handle massive scaling. The service must be able to go from managing a few processes for a couple of customers to being able to support hundreds if not thousands of customers and processes. The service accomplishes that objective by optimizing the underlying cloud services to support this type of elasticity and scaling.
Benefits of Business Process as a Service (BPaaS)
1.	Product/service deliverability: From managing inventory to organizing email and customer records, BPaaS helps companies facilitate the delivery of products and services in an automated, streamlined way with help of cloud technologies. BPaaS is standardized for use across industries and organizations, so it’s flexible and repeatable, resulting in higher efficiency and, ultimately, better service and experience for customers. 
2.	Cutting edge at reduced cost: BPaaS provides a business with the latest digital tools, technologies, processes and talent to improve its efficiency, service and the customer experience, without the large capital investment traditionally required. By implementing BPaaS, companies can shift to a pay-per-use consumption model and reduce total cost of ownership. 
3.	Accommodates fluctuating business needs: BPaaS can scale on-demand when a company experiences a peak workload. Due to its innate configurability applicable across multiple business areas, and its interaction with other foundational cloud services like SaaS, the service can make use of its cloud foundation to scale to accommodate large fluctuations in business process needs.

Cloud service providers (see the center of the diagram) represent all the models of cloud services. A cloud service provider might be a commercial company or a corporation that decides to become its own cloud service operator. Cloud providers may provide the underlying physical and virtualized resources needed to run various cloud services. They also may create the actual applications and business services that operate in these environments.
These various cloud models don’t exist in isolation — they’re all related to each other. In addition, there’s an entire ecosystem of partners that support various vendors with offerings. The cloud service provider provides a unified architecture to support and manage these services consistently. Managing these services is a major requirement for any cloud service provider. These management platforms have to both provide support for the operation of the various services and manage the way they perform to support business requirements.
